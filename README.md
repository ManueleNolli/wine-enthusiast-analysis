## Description 

This document is an analysis of a public dataset found on __[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manyregression/updated-wine-enthusiast-review)__

The dataset contains 80k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, points, taster name and description. Each row represent a review of a wine.

My analysis will focus on the following questions:
- Where are the wines produced?
- What is the distribution of the points?
- What is the distribution of the prices, and is it related to the points?
- What is the distribution of the variety of wines?
- How much tasters are there and how much reviews each of them has done?
  - Are there tasters that are more reliable than others?
  - Have the tasters a preference for a specific continent/country?
- What are the most common words in the description of the wines?
